-- Options are automatically loaded before lazy.nvim startup

-- Add any additional options here

-- Certain but not all LSPs will set the root directory based on which buffer
-- is active. This affects picking files. I found this to be disruptive, for
-- example editing a Lua file in my dotfiles prevented me from fuzzy finding
-- files of the nvim/ directory. Remove this to bring things back to LazyVim's
-- default behavior.
vim.g.root_spec = { "cwd" }

-- The ~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log can get pretty noisy. Mine was ~28MB after 2
-- weeks with the default setting. My thought process here is it can remain OFF
-- by default but if you're looking to troubleshoot something you can
-- temporarily set this to WARN or ERROR.
vim.lsp.set_log_level("OFF")

local opt = vim.opt

-- Show a vertical line at this character.
opt.colorcolumn = "80"

-- Each buffer gets its own status line instead of sharing one.
